title: Qualifiers, restricted assets, addresses, and tags
---

  <p>This is where things really start to get complicated. First you should know that qualifier assets, or simply qualifiers, dictate what addresses can hold a restricted asset by "qualifying" them with a null asset tag. A restricted asset can be associated with 0 or more qualifiers. The main factor in deciding whether or not an address can recieve a restricted asset is whether that address has been qualifier by all of the qualifiers associated with the said restricted asset.</p>
  <p>This means you DO NOT WANT TO SEND QUALIFIERS to addresses you do not trust! Qualifiers are an administrative asset much like ownership assets.</p>
  <p>*phew*</p>
  <p>Lets start out with some definitions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <h4>Asset Tags</h4>
    <p>An asset tag determines whether or not an address is able to receive a restricted asset. It costs 0.1 YERB to create an asset tag. There are three types of asset tags:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><h5>Null Asset Tag</h5>
    <p>A null asset tag has two sub-types:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Qualifying Null Asset Tag: This type of null asset tag can be created with a qualifier asset. It qualifies or unqualifies some address.</li>
    <li>Restricted Null Asset Tag: This type of null asset tag can be created with a restricted asset's ownership asset. It can add or remove an address from being blacklisted from receiving this restricted asset
     no matter the address's qualifications.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h5>Verifier Asset Tag</h5>
    <p>A verifier asset tag can be created with a restricted asset's ownership asset. It associates this restricted asset with one or more qualifiers. (This
   means that to recieve this restricted asset, an address must be qualified by all of the qualifiers defined in this tag).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h5>Restricted Asset Tag</h5>
    <p>Also known as a global freeze tag, a restricted asset tag can be created with a restricted asset's ownership asset. This tag
     can freeze or unfreeze all movements across all addresses of this restricted asset.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>Qualifier Asset</h4>
    <p>Qualifier assets are administrative assets (in the same group as ownership assets) used to determine what addresses can receive restricted assets. Simply owning a qualifier asset gives a user this power.</p>

      <td>Asset Name</td>
      <td><p>The qualifier portion of the name has the same naming rules as a main asset.</p>
      <p>The qualifier asset name takes the form #[qualifier portion]. Note how this is differentiated from unique assets with the fact that a qualifier has no parent. This full name must be less than 30 characters.</p></td>

    </tr>
    </table>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>Sub-qualifier Asset</h4>
    <p>Currently, sub-qualifiers have exactly the same powers as their parents. Sub-qualifiers use a parent qualifier asset in lieu of a parent ownership asset in its creation.</p>

      <p>The sub-qualifier asset name takes the form #[qualifier portion]/#[sub-qualifier]. Note how this is differentiated from unique assets with the fact the the intermediary characters are '/#' This full name must be less than 30 characters.</p></td>

    </tr>
    </table>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>Restricted Asset</h4>
    <p>Restricted assets are comparable to main assets except for the fact that they are, well, restricted. Currently restricted assets can only be associated with main qualifiers (not sub-qualifiers). If a restricted asset is not associated with any qualifier, it cannot be transfered. 
    Restricted assets are also somewhat unique in the fact that if they can be reissued, they are able to change what qualifiers they are associated with.</p>
