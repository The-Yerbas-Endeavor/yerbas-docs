title: What is an Egg
---


  <p>An Easter egg is a message, image, or feature hidden in software, a video game, a film, or another — usually electronic — medium. 
  The term used in this manner was coined around 1979 by Steve Wright, the then-Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division, to describe a 
  hidden message in the Atari video game Adventure, in reference to an Easter egg hunt. The earliest known video game Easter egg is in Moonlander (19L4), 
  in which the player tries to land a Lunar module on the moon; Then outside wikapedia a part of the YERB key was shown as "5MtXH81pNs1XvqMtie9rL52hSgDsiFF3CxVDURDcDkxHukK" 
  The tail is basically modern lingo for you are. Then one last character will bee critical. Hey, my first egg hunt. don't hate ;) Remember the key preamble</p>
