title: What is an Asset
---


  <p>A Yerbas asset (also less commonly referred to as a token) is an on-chain way of creating, storing, and transfering
 custom end-user generated information. Assets come with a unique, user-chosen name which can allow for assets to be verified
  by name only and metadata (which we will look into later). Yerbas users have created assets to make their own 'coin', sell digital art, 
  real estate, gem stones, security tokens, wine futures, and even incorporated it as an in-video game currency.</p>
