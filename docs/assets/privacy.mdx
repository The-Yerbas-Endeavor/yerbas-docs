  <p>A common question about assets is who can see whats on an asset and is there any way to limit viewership of the asset to a recipient.
   The simple answer is that anyone is able to see the data associated with an asset, however there are protocols (see <a href="https://github.com/The-Yerbas-Endeavor/rips/blob/master/rip-0010.mediawiki">RIP-10</a>, <a href="https://github.com/The-Yerbas-Endeavor/rips/blob/master/rip-0011.mediawiki">RIP-11</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/The-Yerbas-Endeavor/rips/blob/master/rip-0014.mediawiki">RIP-14</a>) that allow for the encryption of IPFS data such that only a recipient of an asset may view it.</p>
