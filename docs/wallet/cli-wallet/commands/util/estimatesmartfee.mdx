# estimatesmartfee

_estimatesmartfee conf_target ("estimate_mode")_

Estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin
confirmation within conf_target blocks if possible and return the number of blocks
for which the estimate is valid.

The request target will be clamped between 2 and the highest target
fee estimation is able to return based on how long it has been running.
An error is returned if not enough transactions and blocks
have been observed to make an estimate for any number of blocks.

## Arguments

| Argument  | Type     | Description                     |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| "address" | (string) | The base58check encoded address |

```bash
Arguments:
1. conf_target     (numeric) Confirmation target in blocks (1 - 1008)
2. "estimate_mode" (string, optional, default=CONSERVATIVE) The fee estimate mode.
                   Whether to return a more conservative estimate which also satisfies
                   a longer history. A conservative estimate potentially returns a
                   higher feerate and is more likely to be sufficient for the desired
                   target, but is not as responsive to short term drops in the
                   prevailing fee market.  Must be one of:
       "UNSET" (defaults to CONSERVATIVE)
       "ECONOMICAL"
       "CONSERVATIVE"
```
