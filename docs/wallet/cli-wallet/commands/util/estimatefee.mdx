# estimatefee

_estimatefee nblocks_

DEPRECATED. Please use estimatesmartfee for more intelligent estimates.
Estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin
confirmation within nblocks blocks.

A negative value is returned if not enough transactions and blocks
have been observed to make an estimate.
-1 is always returned for nblocks == 1 as it is impossible to calculate
a fee that is high enough to get reliably included in the next block.

`yerbas-cli estimatefee 6`
