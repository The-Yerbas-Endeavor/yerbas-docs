# walletpassphrase

_walletpassphrase "passphrase" timeout ( mixingonly )_

Stores the wallet decryption key in memory for 'timeout' seconds.
This is needed prior to performing transactions related to private keys such as sending yerbass

Note:
Issuing the walletpassphrase command while the wallet is already unlocked will set a new unlock
time that overrides the old one.

```bash
# Unlock the wallet for 60 seconds
yerbas-cli walletpassphrase "my pass phrase" 60

# Unlock the wallet for 60 seconds but allow PrivateSend mixing only
yerbas-cli walletpassphrase "my pass phrase" 60 true

# Lock the wallet again (before 60 seconds)
yerbas-cli walletlock
```
