# importaddress

_importaddress "address" ( "label" rescan p2sh )_

Adds a script (in hex) or address that can be watched as if it were in your wallet but cannot be used to spend. Requires a new wallet backup.

Note: This call can take minutes to complete if rescan is true.
If you have the full public key, you should call importpubkey instead of this.

Note: If you import a non-standard raw script in hex form, outputs sending to it will be treated
as change, and not show up in many RPCs.

```bash
# Import a script with rescan
yerbas-cli importaddress "myscript"

# Import using a label without rescan
yerbas-cli importaddress "myscript" "testing" false
```
