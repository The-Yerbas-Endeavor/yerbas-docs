# encryptwallet

_encryptwallet "passphrase"_

Encrypts the wallet with 'passphrase'. This is for first time encryption.
After this, any calls that interact with private keys such as sending or signing
will require the passphrase to be set prior the making these calls.
Use the walletpassphrase call for this, and then walletlock call.
If the wallet is already encrypted, use the walletpassphrasechange call.
Note that this will shutdown the server.

```bash
# Encrypt your wallet
yerbas-cli encryptwallet "my pass phrase"

# Now set the passphrase to use the wallet, such as for signing or sending yerbas
yerbas-cli walletpassphrase "my pass phrase"

# Now we can do something like sign
yerbas-cli signmessage "address" "test message"

# Now lock the wallet again by removing the passphrase
yerbas-cli walletlock
```
