# Automatic Setup

Discord community member dk808 (415959001302433802) has created a Smartnode setup script which takes care of all the setup on the Smartnode side. The Smartnode script also creates a child script for updating the Smartnode binaries when needed.

## Preamble

**Please note:**

If you decide to use this script, you will need to construct and run the protx quick_setup command that is covered in the [Manual setup][protx_setup] guide as the script needs the **BLS PrivKey(operatorSecret)** that is given when running the command.

You must now OPT in for using the bootstrap as syncing with chain now takes long enough that setup is complete before syncing is complete resulting in a PoSe ban.

## Guide

### 1. Login to your Smartnode server VIA ssh, create sudo user, and change to that user:

```bash
adduser <username>
usermod -aG sudo <username>
su - <username>
```

### 2. Grab/run script

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dk808/Raptoreum_Smartnode/main/install.sh)
```

:::caution Info

dk808 maintains a bootstrap of the chain. While I personally trust dk808 it should be mentioned that the bootstrap is not an official source or verified by Yerbas.

Official Yerbas bootstraps/powcaches and how to install them can be found [here][bootstrap]

Script source: [dk808/Raptoreum_SmartNode][dk808]

Thank you dk808 for this great contribution!
