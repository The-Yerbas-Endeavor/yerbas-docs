# Shared node services

Shared node services allow you to earn staking rewards on Yerbas without the need to set up your own full Smartnode. The benefit is not being required to have the full Smartnode collateral in YERB before you can start earning rewards.
Below is a list of shared node providers that the Yerbas community recognizes

## iNodez

## SullyNodes

## EvoNodes

## Yerbasnodes
