# Requirements

In order to run a Yerbas Smartnode, you need a server that is capable of running and maintaining the software and connections to the network. While there are no maximum recommended resources, there are some minimum and required specifications in order to allow smooth running of a Smartnode.

In both situations, it is recommended to host a Smartnode with a high-performance VPS provider or on a bare-metal server. 

## Hardware

### Minimum specifications

- 1 CPU core with [SMT][SMT] or [hyperthreading][HT]
- 3 GiB of RAM
- 15 GiB of hard drive space
- 6 GiB of swap disk space
- Fast Ethernet connection

**For VPS:** SSH (Secure Shell) connection is required for remote administration.

**Processor:** At a minimum, we recommend an Intel Celeron or equivalently powerful processor.

**Storage:** The storage space required by a Smartnode increases over time. 15 GiB of storage space will only suffice for installing a Smartnode from scratch at the start. For systems with a larger amount of RAM, a smaller swapdisk can be allocated.

### Recommended specifications

- 2 CPU cores without [SMT][SMT] or [hyperthreading][HT]
- 4 GiB of RAM
- 20 GiB of hard drive space
- Appropriate swap disk space
- 1GBase-T Ethernet connection

Using Solid State Drive powered storage (SATA or [NVMe][NVMe]) is highly recommended.

:::warning Crypto on VPS

Some VPS providers explicitly or implicitly ban use of cryptocurrency software

## Software

Running a smartnode requires some software to be installed as well. 

### Operating system

Officially supported OS:
- Ubuntu 20.04
- ubuntu 22.04 

Using any other OS may result in unexpected behavior and [PoSe][] bans. Installing dependencies VIA Aptitude is only needed if building Raptoreumcore from source, if using released binaries it should not be needed.

Operating system requirements are fairly simple. 

Some installation scripts use Aptitude for managing packages, and will thus not function without. Debian, Ubuntu, and related distributions of Debian are examples of distributions utilizing Aptitude.

**RaptoreumCore packages are built on top of Ubuntu 22.02 LTS and is hence supported by default.**
