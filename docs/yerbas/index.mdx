# What is Yerbas?

![Yerbas](/img/YerbasLogo.png)

Yerbas is a powerful, flexible, and secure POW (Proof Of Work) blockchain and asset platform that will feature NFT/NFTS and Smart Contracts. It is being developed to address problems seen on other blockchains as well as bring in new and innovative ways of addressing these problems. Yerbas development began in November of 2018 and was originally a code fork of RVN (Ravencoin). After multiple bugs, exploits, and security concerns with RVN, the Yerbas team decided to drop the Ravencoin codebase and move to a code fork of DASH (August 2020).

## POW (Proof Of Work) and Mining

Yerbas created an algorithm code named GhostRider. This algorithm was designed to keep ASICS and FPGAs off of the network by making entry cost prohibitive and risky. This allows anybody to mine Yerbas with their CPU and earn a reasonable amount of YERB coins. Yerbas will also be mineable with GPU when a miner has been released. Initial testing shows that GPU will not have an advantage over CPU. $1000 worth of GPU and $1000 worth of CPU may give very similar rewards.

The fact that anyone anywhere can contribute to the network and earn should increase the projects decentralization, unlike networks where ASIC are present or GPU have such a large advantage that CPUs become obsolete. The GhostRider algorithms whitepaper is here:

## Yerbas PrivateSend

Private send is a Yerbas feature inherited from DASH, it allows you to obscure the source of sent YERB. To do this it uses mixing which takes place on the Smartnode network and uses inputs (inputs = coins) from at least two other users that have enabled mixing in their wallets. Your coins never leave your wallet.
