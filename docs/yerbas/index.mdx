# What is Yerbas?

Yerbas is a digital peer to peer network that aims to implement a use case specific blockchain, designed to efficiently handle one specific function: the transfer of assets from one party to another. Built on a fork of the Bitcoin code, Yerbas was launched May 9th, 2022, and is a truly open source project (no ICO or premine). It focuses on building a useful technology, with a strong and growing community.

## How Yerbas works

Launched on May 9th, 2022. Yerbas is an open-source project designed to enable instant payments to anyone around the world. The aim of the project is to create a blockchain optimized specifically for the transfer of assets such as tokens from one holder to another.

## POW (Proof Of Work) and Mining

Yerbas uses an algorithm code named GhostRider. This algorithm was designed to keep ASICS and FPGAs off of the network by making entry cost prohibitive and risky. This allows anybody to mine Yerbas with their CPU and earn a reasonable amount of YERB coins. Yerbas will also be mineable with GPU when a miner has been released. Initial testing shows that GPU will not have an advantage over CPU. $1000 worth of GPU and $1000 worth of CPU may give very similar rewards.

The fact that anyone anywhere can contribute to the network and earn should increase the projects decentralization, unlike networks where ASIC are present or GPU have such a large advantage that CPUs become obsolete. The GhostRider algorithms whitepaper is here:

## Yerbas Assets

A Yerbas asset (also less commonly referred to as a token) is an on-chain way of creating, storing, and transfering custom end-user generated information. Assets come with a unique, user-chosen name which can allow for assets to be verified by name only and metadata (which we will look into later).

## Yerbas PrivateSend

Private send is a Yerbas feature inherited from DASH, it allows you to obscure the source of sent YERB. To do this it uses mixing which takes place on the Smartnode network and uses inputs (inputs = coins) from at least two other users that have enabled mixing in their wallets. Your coins never leave your wallet.
